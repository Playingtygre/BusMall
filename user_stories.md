# Markdown for 5 different users
I have to create a application that is like a website where users have 20 images total. The user starts off by only clicking on a list of three items. Secondly The list then changes not showing the one previous to the user.
Thirdly, the user is given only 25 attempts at selecting items.
Fourthly, there is a counter of clicks near the end where a tally is held.

(users1) User Clicking/shopper
-this person -
A interface must be created so that they can click on various images; he/she is only listed with three images to start off with. Make a selection.


(users2) Inventory Guy
-the Inventory Manager-
This person keeps the Inventory of the images that is clicked, thus far its only 20 items.

(users3) Sales Guy
-Seller-
This is the guy that sells stuff he is responsible for selling items and probably wants to know what is the most clicked item pushed.

(users4) This is me the person that develops the app
-the developer-
I want to start off by loading all the images into containers,
I then want to make a random kicker, then I want to make a random thing
that lets people pick.
