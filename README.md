# BusMall

About project: Image selector on a fake Bus that allows users to select random images.

So this was a project to display three images;
There is a random function given which allows different pictures to show up on
screen.
There is also a click tracker set to 25 clicks after 25 clicks then the tracker stops.

After the tracker stops then the amount of clicks also gets stored onto the local
storage and displays at total clicks for each item.

Another graph is also display which allows for users to see the items and the number
of clicks that shows total vote count.
